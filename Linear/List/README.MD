#  List

List are especially useful if we don't have to perform searches on the items in the list or put them into some type of sorted order.

Linking can be done in two ways â€“ using dynamic allocation and using array index linking.

Linked data structures include linked lists, search trees, expression trees, and many other widely used data structures. They are also key building blocks for many efficient algorithms, such as topological sort and set union-find.


can be impliment: 
  -Linked list: As a singly-linked list with a head pointer.
  -Array: As a dynamic array
  
Queue:
  -Linked list: As a singly-linked list with a head and tail pointer.
  -Array: As a circular buffer backed by an array.

The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while an array has to be declared in the source code, before compiling and running the program. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and can do so with a constant number of operations if the link previous to the link being added or removed is maintained during list traversal.
