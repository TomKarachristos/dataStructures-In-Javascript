# Queues

A queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the
front.The insertion operation is called enqueue, and the removal operation is called dequeue, 
another important queue operation is viewing the element at the front of a queue. This
operation is called peek. The peek operation returns the element stored at the front of
a queue without removing it from the queue.

Queues are used to order processes submitted to an operating system or a print spooler, and simulation
applications use queues to model scenarios such as customers standing in the line at a bank or a grocery store.
