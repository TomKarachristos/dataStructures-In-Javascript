# Priority Queue

A priority queue is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.
In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.
If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps.
