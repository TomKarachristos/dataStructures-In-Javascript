# Binary trees

er. Tree data structures
are used to store hierarchical data, such as the files in a file system, and for storing sorted
lists of data.
Binary trees are chosen over other more primary data structures because you can search
a binary tree very quickly (as opposed to a linked list, for example) and you can quickly
insert and delete data from a binary tree (as opposed to an array).
